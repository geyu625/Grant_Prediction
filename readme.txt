This project used the grant application dataset from the University of Melbourne. Two data mining techniques, gradient boosting trees and random forest, were applied to the dataset to predict the successful applications. Moreover, performance metrics were computed to compare the performance of gradient boosting trees and random forest. Variable importance was also computed by two methods to provide a deep insight on critical factors contributing to the successful grant applications.
